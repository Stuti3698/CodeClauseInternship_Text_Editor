I have developed a Python-based text editor that encompasses the full range of functionalities you'd find in a
standard notepad application. This means it allows you to create new files, open and edit existing ones
, delete files, and save your work. Essentially, it offers a comprehensive set of features similar to those you
would typically encounter in a notepad program. This text editor is a versatile tool for various text-based tasks, 
offering users a familiar and user-friendly experience akin to using a traditional notepad application.
